              In the unlikely event that you wish to return your furniture,
              Sabai Living offer a 30-day returns policy. However, you will be
              charged an administrative fee to cover this. Your refund will be
              processed as soon as the product has been returned to our
              warehouse and has been thoroughly checked for any damage or
              quality issues. Sabai Living can only issue refunds for items that
              are not damaged.
